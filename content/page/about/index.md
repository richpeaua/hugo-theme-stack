Hi, <br/>
I'm Lisiate Peaua. I go by Rich. <br/>
I'm fascinated with the technology, more specifially, software and all the cool things one can do with a computer, a text editor, and some strangely formatted words in a file. I'm currently working as a Platform Engineer, building out software platforms using awesome tech such as Kubernetes, the cloud, and other tools.
This is just a blog to help crystalize ideas and learnings I've gleaned over the years.
