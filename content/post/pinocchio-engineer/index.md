I've recently interviewed with several FAANG and FAANG-adjacent companies.

I Leetcoded, tutorial-ed, and youtubed my way to final round after final round of the interview process. The recruiters told me how great each preceding round went and that feedback was "so far,so good", which left me in sureal disbelief that I'd made it so far and a beaming hope that my dreams would soon come true... until I checked my email a week later, after each final interview. <br/>

They all read along the same lines as... <br/>
> "Thank you for your interest in exploring career opportunities with <INSERT_COMPANY> and taking time to interview for the <INSERT_POSTITION> opportunity. We were impressed with your skills and experience, however, the team has decided not the move forward with your candidacy for this role."

And \*poof\*... just like that. My hopes evaporated like a fart in a hurricane. 

Each email chipped away a piece of me...

I felt my identity as a Senior Platform Engineer, with close to 6 years under my belt in DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering roles, unraveling. Imposter syndrome had never hit me harder.

I wondered, after the 3rd rejection, if I was just unlucky this time around, especially due to recent economic troubles (even though these companies were setting [Wall Street records](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/tech-layoffs-jump-in-january-as-alphabet-meta-microsoft-reach-high.html)). After the 5th, I blamed AI. After the 7th, I started running out of excuses. 

How was I able to make it so far in so many notoriously difficult interview processes and still not land a ***single one***?. Why couldn't I seal the deal?

# The Problems

After pacing around my bedroom/office for hours on and off over the course of a week with my Blues Clues thinking cap on, reflecting, I came to the realization of what the ***real*** problem truly was. Two problems, actually: <br/>
- Competition
- Skill Issues

### 1. Competition

Due to the mass layoffs, which have ***especially*** impacted tech positions, with giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, many other companies [laying off OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND workers](https://layoffs.fyi/), the flood gates have been opened. Hell, the ***whole dam*** has collapsed, and the market is overflowing with talent.

> "Toto, I've a feeling we're not in 2020 anymore" 

2020\. a year when companies were hiring tech workers faster than the Javascript community was pumping out frameworks. When my LinkedIn and email inboxes were being inundated with recruiter spam. Aaahh back in good 'ol 2020, before the phrase **"hiring freeze"** was invented.



Unfortunately, it's 2024 and those good times are long gone. AI has come with the morbid promise to <INSERT_SOUTH_PARK_MEME> "tekur jrrbs". Economy has been a factor, maybe not for big tech, but definitely for other industries and the start up scene.

### 2. Skill Issues

I'm a dumb, college dropout that stumbled my way through the Tech field, starting out in humble IT Support and fell upwards into Network Admin, System Admin, and finally the messy DevOps/SRE/DevSecOps/Platform Engineer space.


# The Problem

It sounds weird... I want to become a real engineer, but I've, technically, ***been*** a DevOps/Site Reliabitliy/DevSecOps/Platform "Engineer" for the past 6 years. What gives?

This may be a "hot take" but, unless you're at a FAANG or FAANG-adjacent tech company where the titles I've mentioned actually ***engineer*** solution (tools, apps, platforms) to solve insane scaling problems, those postions are just a rebrand of **Systems Administrator**.

Modern DevOps is more Ops than it is Dev and most of my career I've spent glueing engineered tools and software together.

Sure, I've written a vast amount of Python and Bash scripts to automate things but scripting is not, IMHOP, engineering.

Heck, I write more yaml and Terraform HCL "code", then anything else on a day to day.

I've failed so many interviews with great companies I've really wanted to work for due to three main things:
1) Lack of real software development experience.
2) Lack of large systems design knowledge.
3) Lack of an ability to effectively articulate complex, technical topics

Or to summarize, skill issues.

Now, I've gone through Leetcode Hell, Tutorial Hell and watched every Systems Design course on the Youtubes and, at one point, made it to the final interviewing round at FaceBook (now Meta), but all that "knowledge" just evaporates, like fart in a hurricane, post-interview prep.

I didn't gain any real ***skills*** from interview prep.

I want to, not only learn these things and make them stick in this dumb head of mine, I want to genuinely ***master*** these subjects... and become a "REAL ENGINEER"<sup>TM</sup>

So this was all long winded way of saying I want to get really, truly good at:
- engineering software (low-level, optimize ram and cpu utilization, architecture, design)
- designing systems
- communicating technical topics

# The Solution

How am I going to do it?..

After despressingly binging Youtube for answers
Greate question, thank you for asking. I'm going to do it through the tried and true method of gaining skills through practice.

There really is no other way around it.

# Conclusion

No more Youtube channels...<br/>
No more Leetcode Hell (except maybe as a form of putting my learnings into practice)...<br/>
No more Tutorial Hell...

Just some good 'ol fashioned slow and steady hardwork.
